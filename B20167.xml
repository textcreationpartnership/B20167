            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Advertisement TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPON the Publication of the <hi>Second Volume</hi> of Mr. <hi>CHARNOCK'S</hi> Works, it was much lamented by those that knew him, and had a just value for him, that some Sermons he was known to have preached (and which were as worthy of the publick View as the rest, and no less useful to the grand design
<pb facs="tcp:200538:4"/> of mans Salvation) could not be found among his Papers; especially three Sermons which many heard him preach on Three several Lord's-days, upon <hi>1 Tim. 11.15. Christ Jesus came into the World to save sinners.</hi> But now, beyond expectation, instead of them, the good Providence of God hath brought to light the Two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatises, by the unwearied Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Mr. <hi>Ashton,</hi> one of the laborious Transcribers of the First Volume of this Author's Works; and who, to give him his due, hath rak'd them out of the Ashes, and rescued them from that oblivion to which they seemed condemned; having with great Pains and Patience transcribed, as well as with great Judgment joined together the several Materials he found belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing respectively to each Subject, in
<pb facs="tcp:200538:4"/> the many loose Papers of Mr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> he had by him. The Papers I have seen, and with Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s help, have (so far as was needful) compared the Transcription with them.</p>
            <p>One of these Treatises contains the Continuation of the Author's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on <hi>1 Tim. 1.15.</hi> And herein he handles a second Doctrine, grounded on the last Clause of the Verse. The Text was fruitful, and bore twins; whereof the younger only survives; the other, I fear, is dead without recovery.</p>
            <p>But I verily persuade my self, that many an honest Soul will have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bless the Lord for the Birth, (shall I say?) or the Resurrection of this still-born Offspring of so worthy a Father, being thereby stirr'd up
<pb facs="tcp:200538:5"/> not only to admire that rich Grace of God which so eminently appears in many times calling the Chiefest of Sinners, but encouraged in the Faith of it, and supported under the burden of the greatest guilt which we find so often oppressing, terrifying, and even sinking awaken'd Sinners into despair, when they look upon their Sins as not only above the Sins of others, but even above the Mercy of God it self, and therefore unpardonable. If secure Sinners shall dare to abuse the great Truths here declared and set forth, to the strengthening their hands in their evil Works, and emboldening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a life of Sin, because God's Grace abounds; at their peril be it, and let them answer for it. But in the mean time it is pity that such rich and precious Cordials should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb facs="tcp:200538:5"/> from those that need them, lest others to whom they do not belong should presumptuously catch at them and undo themselves by misapplying them. And who knows not, that what is a Cordial to some, may prove Poison to others?</p>
            <p>As for the other Discourse, Of <hi>Man's Enmity against God,</hi> we cannot find when or where it was preached. I have been credibly informed, that the Author had a design (had it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to have prolonged his days) to have preached largely about <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin,</hi> and then it is not unlikely that he might intend this present Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise as one branch of it. And in it, if the Reader can but dispense with one degree less of that accuracy and neatness of stile which usually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his other Writings, he will
<pb facs="tcp:200538:6"/> find as excellent Matter, and great things as in most of them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true Spirit of the Author. He had made great use of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in beating out the Truth, but wanted time to apply the File for the more thorough smoothing and polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Work, which truly wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the finishing-stroke. The Thread of this Discourse is as finely spun as of any, tho' the Piece be not altogether so glossy. But whatever is wanting in Ornament, is abundantly made up in Usefulness. And if one of these Treatises may be a Glass in which humbled Sinners may see the beauty and glory of Soveraign Grace, the other too may be a Glass in which the best of Saints may see the Face of their own Souls, and a lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of that inherent Wickedness,
<pb facs="tcp:200538:6"/> which all that diligently observe and know their own hearts, cannot but acknowledge to be natural to them, as having been born with them into the World. I cannot but say that this Discourse is an excellent Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of the Old Man; a Graphical description of the Devils Image im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd upon, and deforming the most beautiful part of this lower Creation. It shews how much Man is debased and degraded by Sin, and become a Slave to his Lusts, who was made at first to be the Lord of his Fellow-Creatures; and so how rueful a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy our first Father hath left us, and to what misery he hath intail'd us, by communicating so cursed a Nature to us. That the blessing of God may be upon these Labours of his (long since) deceased, but faithful Servant; and
<pb facs="tcp:200538:7"/> that they may, by the power of his Grace, be made effectual for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ends designed by the Author is the desire and prayer of him who is, Good Reader,</p>

            <p>There is not such a hatred absolutely between God and Man, though there be between God and Sin: Because there may be a reconciliation between God and a Sinner, but not between God and Sin: For Antipathies are irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:200538:17"/>
            <p>The enmity between God and a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not founded in Nature, but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature; and this Nature may be remov'd by satisfaction and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>A fundamental Reconciliation was the great intendment of God in the death of Christ: For he was in him as in his Ambassador reconciling the World unto himself: And an actual reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is made between God and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soul at the first instant of faith; though this reconciliation be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, yet not between God and the Corrupt Nature of Man: For it would be against God's Nature to be reconcil'd to that, though he be his Creature; because since his Nature is infinitely good, he cannot but love goodness, as it is a resemblance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and consequently cannot but abhor unrighteousness, as being most distant from his Nature; and therefore never will express any dearness or intimacy to man's Corrupted Nature, but to man justify'd and regenerate.</p>
            <p>But the enmity which is between God and Sin is founded in the Nature
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:200538:18"/> of God, and the Nature of Sin. Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>summum Malum,</hi> the greatest Evil, is naturally most opposite to God, who is the <hi>summum Bonum,</hi> the greatest Good.</p>
            <p>So that God can never be reconcil'd to Sin, or Sin to God: For on the one side God must part with his Holiness, or Sin with its Malice and Impurity, and so God cease to be God, or Sin cease to be Sin.</p>
            <p>As God is unchangeably good both in Nature and Decree, so Sin is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably Evil. As God can never cease to be good, so Sin can never cease to be Sin; because the natural imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Law of God can never cease to be his Law, because it is grounded upon eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>God's Nature is against Sin: For if his hating Sin were a meer voluntary Act, he might then either love it, or detest it, which he pleas'd. But is God unrighteous to love unrighteousness? No, 'tis a voluntary, natural Act.</p>
            <p>The hatred Sin hath to God, hath no mixture of love; the hatred a man hath to God, may have some mixture of a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:200538:18"/> natural love, because of the kindness he knows he receives from God.</p>

            <p>Reason will acquaint men with a First Cause; and that their Beings are produced and preserved by a power superior to their own.

            <p>In this respect natural men from a common ingenuity, have some starts of love to God, though this is not a love of a right impression: because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects not the Excellency of God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the agreeableness of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to us, and so is rather a self-love, as

            <p>I will appeal to your selves; Did none of you ever please your selves sometimes in the thoughts, how happy you should be, how free in your lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleasures, if there were no God?</p>
            <p>Have you not one time or other wished, there were no Law given above to restrain you, no Conscience within to check you, no Judge hereafter to Sentence you? And can God be hated worse, than when the destruction of his inseparable Perfections, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Righteousness, are thought so desirable? It is a wishing the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Being.</p>
            <p>Hatred as defin'd by one,<note place="margin">Scaliger Exercit. 316. S. 1.</note> to be <hi>Appetitus amorendi rem aliquem.</hi> As Love is a desire of union, Hatred must be a desire of separation. And <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> tells us, That Hatred is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a higher strain than Anger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it desires the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not being of the hated Object.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:200538:27"/>
            <p>As the hatred of Sin aims at the destruction of Sin, and men's hatred of Saints would cause their Expulsion out of the World; so the hatred of God is a desire to despoil him of his Being. And their not doing it, is not for want of an innate disposition, but for want of strength; for Men hate God more than the best Saint doth Sin. All ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred includes a virtual Murder, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whosoever hates his brother, is a murderer.</hi> If he who hates his Brother is in the Court of exact Judgment a Murderer of his Brother, he that hates God is a Murderer of God.</p>
            <p>The more self-love we have, the more we shall hate that which we judge destructive to us; because the more we wish well to our selves, the more we wish ill to that which we imagine contrary to our well-being.</p>
            <p>And since we hate those acts of God which flow from the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his nature, we consequently rise up to a hatred of God's being; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not be God, unless he loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; and he could not testify his love to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:200538:27"/> one, or his loathing the other, but in encouraging Goodness, and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Anger against Iniquity.</p>
            <p>Man would have God at the greatest distance from him; and there is no greater distance from being, than not being, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. who say unto God, <hi>Depart from us.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.1. The Fool hath said in his heart, <hi>No God,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew; I wish there were no God, and this is founded upon sin: for the reason rendred, is, that <hi>they are corrupt, and have done abominable works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence is Sin by some call'd <hi>Deicidium,</hi> a slaughtering of God: because every sin being Enmity to God, doth virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in its nature the destruction of God.</p>
            <p>And since every man naturally is a Child of the Devil, and is acted by the Diabolical Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The spirit that now works in the Children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> he must necessarly have that nature which his Father hath, and the infusion of all that venom which the Spirit that acts him, is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with, though the full discovery of it may be restrain'd by various Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. And this assertion seems
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:200538:28"/> to be intimated in the death of Christ; for when we see, for the satisfaction of the dishonour done to God, Christ must die for Sin, it intimates, that if it were possible, God should die by Sin. If sin can be expiated by no less than the blood of God, it seems to imply, that in its own nature it aims at no less than the Life of God; because all God's punishments are founded <hi>in lege talionis,</hi> and are highly Equitable.</p>
            <p>For confirmation, That a state of Nature is a state of Enmity.</p>
            <p>The very design of Christ coming into the World being an errand of peace, and the management of this design both when he was conversant in the World, and since his ascension, being to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God and Man, and to promote by his Spirit an acceptance of this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, plainly discovers the state Man was in, wherein Man injur'd God, and was punished by him: for what need of piecing up a friendship, if there had not been an antecedent Enmity?</p>
            <p>There was a Moral Enmity against God on our parts, which must needs draw a legal Enmity on God's part against us.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:200538:28"/>
            <p>But the Apostle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it; <hi>If when we are enemies, we were reconcil'd to God.</hi> If when we were enemies, <hi>we all of us;</hi> not the best Saint on Earth, nor the most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous glorifi'd Saint in Heaven, but had once this black Character of being God's Enemy.</p>

            <p>Every Man naturally is like the Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that no holy motion can flutter over it, but falls down dead, being choak'd by those steams which exhale from the corruption of the heart.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There are the Characters of a Deity engraven upon every Man by nature, so deeply in Men's Consciences, that it is impossible for all the malice of the Devil to raze it out. But if we make a judgment of Men's hearts by the Counterpart of them in their Lives, and consider Men's Practices, which are the best indexes of their Principles, we shall quickly find by tracing the streams how corrupt the Fountain is.</p>

            <p>Men will not have God reign over them: They will not have God for their Governour, nor his Law for their Rule.</p>
            <p>Our created Arms cannot reach Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to pull God from his Throne; but there is a radical disposition in Man to do it, had he ability equivalent to his Corruption. For what is the great

            <p>While we exclude him from being the Lord of our Hearts, we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from being the Lord of the World; for that unjust principle which doth deprive him of the heart, would deprive him also of the other; to which God hath no greatet Right, nor no juster Title than he hath to our heart, over which we will not let him reign.</p>
            <p>Sin is therefore call'd <hi>Rebellion;</hi> which is a denial of subjection to him as our Lord; 'tis an act of Disloyalty, a breach of Allegiance. As the <hi>Jews</hi> say of every Judgment upon them, That there is some of the dust of the golden Calf; <hi>i. e.</hi> something of the punishment of their first Idolatry. So we may say, That in every Sin there is a taint of that first Prodigious ambition of our first Parents, which cost them and their posterity so dear, <hi>viz.</hi> That we would be as Gods, we would be God's equals, if not superiors.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:200538:30"/>
            <p>The Enmity against this Soveraignty is in three things:

                  <item>1. In the <hi>breach of God's Laws.</hi>
                  </item>

            </p>
            <p>That Servant that doth not perform his Master's Command, doth virtually deny his Authority.</p>
            <p>If Obedience be a sign of love, Disobedience is an argument of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>Joh. 14.15. <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> If Obedience to God enobles us with the glorious title of God's <hi>Friends, Joh.</hi> 15.14. Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God must needs expose us to the unworthy Character of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>And indeed the breach of God's Laws is not only a discarding his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, but a casting dirt upon his other Attributes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note>For if his Command be <hi>holy, just, and good;</hi> if it be the image of God's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the transcript of his Righteousness,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200538:30"/> and the efflux of his Goodness, then in the breach of it all those Attributes are despis'd. The Law is then slighted as it is a Medal of God's Holiness, as it is equitable in its self, and as it is in its goodness design'd for our conveniency and advantage.</p>
            <p>Therefore by the Breach of one point of the Law, we contract virtually the guilt of the Contempt of the whole Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-book of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;</hi> because the Will and Authority of the Lawgiver, which gives the Sanction to it is oppos'd: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, because that the Authority of the Lawgiver, which is not prevalent with us, to restrain us from the Breach of one Point, would be of as little force with us to restrain us from the Breach of all the rest, when occasion is offer'd; because also the Breach of any one Law declares a want of that Love which is the Sum and Spirit of the whole Law.</p>
            <p>This Enmity to God's Law, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in these Ten Things.</p>

            <p>Men affect an Ignorance of God's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200538:31"/> Command; they are loth to inform themselves; they hate the Light, which would both discover their Spots, and direct their Course.</p>

            <p>When God presses in upon them by inward Motions, or outward Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Will, they secretly desire God not to trouble them with his Laws, though their hearts bear witness to the Righteousness of them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.10, 11. <hi>Which say to the Prophets, Prophecy not unto us right things: cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</hi> Let not the Holy One of <hi>Israel</hi> trouble us with any of his Laws, but leave us to our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Labour.

            <p>And when any motion of the Spirit thrusts it self in, to enlighten them, they <hi>exalt themselves against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. and resist the Holy Ghost, keep their Hearts barr'd, that he may not have admittance. The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. is empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, To fall against; as a Stone or any other ponderous Body falls against that which lies in its way; they would dash in pieces or grind to powder that very motion which is made for their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yes, and the Spirit too which makes it; and that not in a fit of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but from an habitual Enmity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. Whereas a faithful Subject or Servant who loves his Prince or Master, would fain know what his Will is, and what Laws are order'd, that he may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them.</p>
            <p>But when men have a superficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God's Laws by Education, or Attendance upon a godly and able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, yet they are loath to retain it, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in improving it; they easily let it slip from them, their minds have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to employ themselves in <hi>meditating</hi> of it, or to know the spirit of it, which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> fixes as the Character of a Godly Man, <hi>Ps.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:200538:32"/>
            <p>Men are more generally fond of the Knowledge of any thing, than of God's Will. Do not the most of Men, that are intent upon Knowledge, spend more Time, and engage more serious and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Thoughts in the study of some Science or Trade, than in the Knowledge of God's Will? With what readiness and dexterity will a man discourse about Philosophy, Mathematicks, History, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but any discourse of God began in Company, strikes them dead: He is quite at a loss in the Knowledge of Him and his Will, which was the great End of his coming into the World, and the great Concern of his Soul.</p>
            <p>But if a man doth desire to know the Law of God, it is many times more out of a curiosity and natural itch to know, than any design to come under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it; therefore many Men that can dispute for the Principles of Religion, are asham'd of the practice, and asham'd to discourse much of the practical part of it; which is a contradictory thing: for can the profession be honourable, if the practice be vile? If the principles be true and good, and worthy to be known, why are they not practised? If the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:200538:32"/> be disgraceful, why are the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which lead to such Practices, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and studied? Whence can this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Ignorance of Gods Laws, this care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less enquiry into his Will arise, but from an Enmity against it, for fear they should be disturb'd by it in the pursuit of their carnal pleasures? therefore they account the Word of the Lord <hi>a reproach</hi> to them and their ways, and a rtouble to have their Consciences set on work by the Law that galls them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.10.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When Men cannot escape the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Knowledge of the Law, but it breaks in upon them as the Morning-light, they set up their Carnal Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against it, Jer. 44.16. <hi>As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee:</hi> And harden their hearts with <hi>a stoutness</hi> against God, Mal. 3.13. <hi>Refuse to walk in his law,</hi> Psal. 78.10. Though it be a <hi>strength to them,</hi> yet they will not, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.15. they would rather guide themselves to destruction, than be under God's Conduct to happiness: They would rather be their own Rulers, than
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:200538:33"/> God's Subjects. Men naturally affect an unbounded Liberty; would not have the Bridle of a Command to check them, or be hedg'd in by any Law: They think it too slavish a thing to be guided by the will of another: They are well compared to the Wild Ass, that loves to snuff up the Wind at her pleasure in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: They will take their own course, rather than come under the guidance of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. Since the Law checks the inward Operations of the Soul, and would keep them from inward as well as outward compliances with Sin; they therefore account it a heavy Yoke to be so strictly regulated as not to have their secret retirements and dalliances with sin in their thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let not God speak to us,</hi> say the <hi>Jews,</hi> Exod. 20.19, 20. <hi>lest we dye.</hi> One would think it was the Terror of the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps wherewith the Law was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that made them so unwilling to hear God speak to them. But the Apostle tells us it was the hatred of the Law it self; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.20. <hi>For they could not endure that which was commanded;</hi> which Particle, <hi>For,</hi> shews it to be a reason why they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd the word should not be spoken to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:200538:33"/> them any more. They had a natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness to be guided by any Statute of God's enacting. Had they been only afraid of those terrible Lightnings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aversion to God himself, methinks they should not so suddenly after have preferred a Golden Calf, the similitude of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idol, and put the Name of God upon it, and ascribe to it their Deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> which had been wrought, not by a senseless Calf, but an Almighty and outstretched Arm. Therefore in the Charge God brought against them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.43. <hi>Because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes;</hi> he accuseth them not only of despising his Judgments, but of a rooted abhorrency of them even in their Souls. There is not a Law but the heart of man natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath a secret and rooted detestation of.</p>
            <p>Hence man is said to make void the Law of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.126. They have <hi>made void thy law.</hi> To make it of no obligation to them, as if it were an Almanack out of date; which Christ calls a making <hi>the law of none effect, Mat.</hi> 15.6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; you have <hi>unlorded</hi> the Law; put it out of Commission; thrown
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:200538:34"/> off all the power and Dominion of it: Which Law God values more than he doth the whole World; nay, the least tittle of it is so dear to him, that it shall stand, when Heaven and Earth shall fall. And to vindicate the Honour of it, he would have his Son to dye for a Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the breach of it. So that if a man could destroy the whole World, it were not so bad as Sin, which is an unlor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is an act of God's Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Copy of his Holiness; whereas the making the World was but an act of his Wisdom and Executive Power; nay, God would not be so angry at it; because his Power is by that contemned; but in this, his Holiness, which is an Attribute he doth particularly delight in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Violence man offers to those Laws,</hi> which God doth most strictly enjoin, and which he doth most delight in the performance of.</p>
            <p>If a man be willing to be determin'd by some Law of God, it's not because it is his Law, but because it doth not run counter to some beloved Lust of his. But when God enjoins any thing which is against the beloved interest of the flesh he flies out in rage against God; and the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:200538:34"/> interest of his corrupt Affection excites him to a loathing of that wich is truly good.</p>
            <p>The strictness of the Law, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men account their Band and Shac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, is the ground of their Quarrel with God, the reason of their Rage and their Counsel against God and his Christ: <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let us break their bands, and cast away their cords from us:</hi> All this was, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. for the strictness of his Law; which <hi>Grotius</hi> understands of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Rights of it; but meant certainly of the Evangelical Law of Christ, the Psalm being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of him.</p>
            <p>If a man be willing to comply with any Law of God, it is as it prohibits some outward Carnal Sins; but the more spiritual the Law, the more averse the Heart. The more spiritual the Law is, the more doth indwelling Sin exercise its Power, and endeavour to encrease our slavery; Rom. 7.14. <hi>The law is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.</hi> The Apostle there intimates, that our Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, our Slavery to Sin, the Enmity of our hearts to God, is best discerned by comparing man with the Spirituality of the Law.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:200538:35"/>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were much for Sacrifices, and very diligent in them, which were but the Skirts of the Law, and which God did not principally require at their hands; but for Holiness, Mercy, Pity, and other duties most valued by God, they were mere strangers unto them. Men will grant God the Lip, and the Ear, but deny him that which he most calls for, <hi>viz</hi> the Heart.</p>
            <p>The more earnestly Conscience doth at any time urge the Law, the more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously will the Flesh act against it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. But <hi>sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.</hi> Like as the boisterous Waves, which roar most at that Bank or Rock which forbids their progress; or like Wind, which pent within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compass of the Earth, grows more violent.</p>
            <p>Had not God commanded some things so strictly, they had not been broken so frequently. God's righteous Laws, which are intended to check our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, are occasions to enrage them; as the Vapour in a Cloud ends in a tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clap of Thunder when it meets with opposition.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:200538:36"/> it puts him in mind of the law of God.</hi> Man cannot naturally endure a quick and lively practical thought of God and his Law, and is an Enemy to his own Conscience for putting him in mind of God. This is evidenced by our stifling of Conscience, when it doth dictate any practical conclusions from the Law, and would stamp suitable impressions upon the Soul. As it is an evidence of an Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in one Man against another, when he cannot bear his Company, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear him speak; so it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an Enmity to God, when a Man cannot cannot endure to listen to that which is in himself, and more intimate with him than any Friend he hath, for the wholesome and necessary advice it gives him as God's Viceroy in him.</p>
            <p>Which is not an Enmity to Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it self, or to its act of self reflection, but to the matter of it as it is God's Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent and Representative, and bears the marks of his Authority in it, and presseth the holy Law of God upon the mind and heart.</p>
            <p>Because in other cases this self-reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act of Conscience is welcome, and is cherished, where it doth not act in a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:200538:36"/> way of Soveraignty deriv'd from God, but suitable to natural affections. As suppose a Man hath in a passion struck his Child that caus'd some great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to him, his Conscience reflecting upon him afterwards, will be welcome, and shall work some tenderness in him, which it shall not do in the more spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al concerns of God, but shall rather be loathed by him as a busy-body.</p>
            <p>And by such frequent oppositions of Conscience, this Enmity doth so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, that the Soveraignty of Conscience seems to be quite Cashier'd, insomuch that it ceaseth with any efficacy to spur on the Soul to good, or withdraw it from evil; and being overpower'd by sinful habits, its Commands grow weak, and it sits labouring like a Magistrate that cannot stem the tide of ill manners in a Commonwealth; it enjoins as if it had no mind to be observ'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis upon this account that Men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes cannot endure to hear any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Discourses of God, because they excite unwelcome reflections in their own Consciences; which instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, do more distemper them; as the sweetest Perfumes affect a weak Head with Aches.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:200538:37"/>
            <p>Now since Men hate their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences for putting them in mind of God's Laws, it is clear that they hate God himself, because Conscience is God's Officer in them: Since they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Memorials and Prints of God in the Conscience: Since they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy God's Commissioner for doing his work, they would destroy God himself. The Apostle therefore calls Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Light of Nature, a Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. <hi>To them that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and obey not the truth,</hi>

            <p>And as the disowning the Principles of the Christian Doctrine, after a taste

            <p>Sin having set up this Law, makes it the Measure and Rule of Righteousness, and measures also the Righteousness of God's Law by this Law of his own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; nay, measures the Holiness and

This is horrible, to makes God's Law no holier than our own, and to square God's Holiness and Righteousness according to our Conceptions; as if God's Holiness were to be tried by our Measures, and judged by our Corruption, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Thou thoughtest I was altogether such a one as thy self.</hi> This Men do when they plead for Sins as little, as venial, as that which is below God to take notice of; because they themselves think it so, therefore God must think it so too.</p>
            <p>Man with a Gyant-like Pride, would climb into the Throne of the Almighty, and establish a Contradiction to the Will of God by making his own Will, and not God's, the Square and Rule of his Actions.</p>

This seems to be Obedience in the Act, but Disobedience in the Motive; for it is not a respect to God, but to our selves: At the best it is but the performance of the material part, without the spiritual Manner, which is most regarded by God.</p>
            <p>Besides, if we observe any Law upon the account of its Suitableness to our Natural Sentiments, or Carnal Designs, we shall as readily disobey, when it crosses the Purposes of our Minds, or Desires of the Flesh; for our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be changeable, according to the Mutations we find in our own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Though so palpable Idolatry be not committed by us, yet it was natural to mankind; since we know all Nations were over-run with it, <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.2. Since the Father of the Faithful was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before he was a Believer. And his Posterity the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had heard God himself speak to them from Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:200538:47"/> were no sooner departed from the foot of the Mountain, but they adore a Golden Calf in his stead; and this sin did run in the blood of all their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; since we find God charging them with it through the whole Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and was not rooted out till the Seventy Years Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the naturalness of it to mankind may further appear, consider what Incentives against it the <hi>Jews</hi> had. They had the greatest Appearances of God, particular marks of his Favour, his Judgments and Statutes; which the <hi>Psalmist (Psal.</hi> 147.19, 20.) sets an Emphasis upon, That he had not dealt so with every Nation, no, not with any Nation. They had the visible signs of his Presence, the Pillar of Fire by Night, and the Cloud by Day; they were more particularly under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Care; he had alter'd the Course of Nature, and wrought Miracles for their Deliverance; rain'd <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven to spread their Table, carried them in his Bosom; yet those Wretches were throwing down God, to make room for a Calf, made, as I may say,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:200538:47"/> with the Gold, which was besmear'd with their Ear-wax, daub'd with an Excrement.</p>
            <p>This Idolatry is as absolute a degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and vilifying of God as Hell it self could invent; 'Tis a real calling him by the names of all those filthy, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, senseless Creatures, so odious, as Images of him. As if God were no better than a Stone, a piece of carved Brass or Wood, of no greater Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than an Image or Puppet: This is a denying of God. <hi>Job</hi> speaking, that he had not kiss'd his hand, or made obeysance to Idols; for then, saith he, <hi>I should have deni'd the God that is above,</hi> Job 31.28.</p>

            <p>The giving Adoration to an Image which belongs to God, is a making it equal to him, if not above him; for by such a Veneration they evidence, that God is no better in their apprehension than the Stock they worship.</p>
            <p>The Heathen World is at this day drenched in this kind of Idolatry, and

This is the great Usurper in the World, for it invades the Right of God; 'tis the most direct compliance, and likeness to the Devil, whose Actions center wholly in malicious Self-will: In this respect I suppose the Devil is call'd <hi>the God of this World,</hi> because he acts so,

Now to make our selves the end, and all other things to act for our selves, is to make our selves the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, to deny any superior as the Center to which our Actions should be directed, and usurp God's place, who along being the supreme Being, can be his own End: For if there were any thing higher and better than God, his own Purity and Goodness would cause him to act for that as more noble and worthy.</p>

            <p>This some think to be the Sin of the Devils, affecting an independency on God by a proud Reflection upon their own created Excellency, and at least a delightful Wish, if not an Endeavour to make themselves the ultimate End of all their Actions.</p>

If you preferr'd some honourable thing which might perfect your Natures, as Learning, Wisdom, Moral Virtues; though this were an indignity to be censur'd by the Judge of all the World, yet it would be more tolerable; but to consecrate your Heart and Time to a sordid Voluptuousness, and feed it with the Cream of your Strength, this is an inexcusable Contempt, to pay a quick and lively Service to an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Delight, which is only due to the supreme Lord.</p>

And if men are enemies to that truth which doth most clearly discover God, and his mind, and cannot endure the thoughts of it, much less can they endure the thoughts of God himself.

If any Truth presseth in upon them, they turn it away, as Men do importunate Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars; We have nothing for you; Do not trouble us, we have no Alms to bestow upon you: And the reason is, because Men having abortivated and deadned all those reliques and natural infusions of God in their Soul, any live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Truth and Apprehensions of him proves most unsavoury: As Wine and Strong waters, which have lost their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirit, become most ungrateful and unpleasant to the Stomach; so those innate impressions of God which are so refreshing to a good Man, they do what they can to shake off or taint them, by mingling with them their own corrupt Notions; and when they cannot, they are fill'd with an irreligious rancour against God. Men keep the Truths that rise up in themselves for convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and instruction, in unrighteousness, and quench the motions of the Blessed Spirit, killing them in the Womb. Have not Men often had secret Wishes, that the Scripture had never mention'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:200538:83"/> some Truths, or that they were blotted out of the Bible, because they face their Consciences, damp their Pleasures, and cool their boiling Lusts, which else they would with eagerness and delight pursue.</p>

            <p>Which would be if there were a love to God: for Men love to read over the Letters which are sent by them to whom they have an affection, and stick them up, or peruse them afterwards at their leisure. And it was an unclean Beast that did not chew the Cud under the Law; so it is a corrupt Heart that doth not chew Truth by Meditation.

Many have the Knowledge of God, who have no delight in it; as Owls and Batts have Eyes to perceive the Light, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Weakness of their Sight have no delight in it to look cheerfully upon it; so neither can a Man by his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or acquir'd Knowledge delight in God, or love to look upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his Corruption.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:200538:88"/> testifies that men care not for any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence or Friendship between God and their Souls. Man having an Enmity to true Holiness, hath from thence an Enmity to Prayer, because Holiness must at least be pretended in Prayer, because in that Duty there is a real speaking to God, and a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, unto which Holiness is required. Now as wicked men hate the Truth of Holiness, because it is unsuitable to them, so they are not Friends to the pretence of it in that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because they must for some space be diverted from the thoughts of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lusts. I appeal to you, whether you are not more unwilling to practice Prayer in your Closets, than to join with others, as if it were a going to the Rack, and rather your Penance than Privilege. If men do come to God, it is a constrained Act, to satisfy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and such are rather servile, than Son-like Performances, and spring from bondage more than affection. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science like a Taskmaster did not lash them to duty, they would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. If we do come willingly, it

            <p>If God doth not answer us, naturally we cast off the Duty, and say with those in <hi>Job, Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him?</hi> They pray not out of Conscience of the Command, but merely for the Profit; and if God makes them wait for it, they will not wait his leisure, but sollicite him no longer. There are two things express'd; That God was not worthy of their Service; and, That the serving of him would not bring them in a good Revenue, or an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that kind they expected. 'Tis Interest draws men on to Prayer; and when that is not advanc'd, they will beg no more; like some Beggars, if you give them not presently upon their asking, from blessing they turn to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:

Whereas Love moves upon a sense of Duty, a Natural man that hath an aversion, moves upon a sense of Interest. Love is encouraged by Answer, but is not dissolv'd by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but a Natural man would have God at his beck, and steers his course in duty by the outward profit, not by the inward pleasure.</p>

Darkness and Light, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell are directly contrary; so is Christ and <hi>Belial.</hi> Let Engagements be what they will, so long as Men are of different Spirits, they cannot agree.

            <p>There are in God and Men different Ends. Man's End is to please himself, and satisfy the Desires of the Flesh; God's End is to vindicate his Law, and show himself the Righteous Governor of the World, which cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

            </p>
            <p>Men fly from God out of shame; they consider the Debts they owe God are great; and naturally Debtors fly from their Creditors, for fear they should exact or demand any thing of them, <hi>Adam</hi>'s Guilt was rather attended with a flight from him, than with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him. Those <hi>Israelites</hi> that desir'd God no more to speak to them but by <hi>Moses,</hi> were afraid of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence too, when his Face shone with an heavenly Splendor. Terror is essential to Guilt, and Hatred to a perpetual Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Their Guilt made them fly from that <hi>Moses</hi> whom they knew to be their friend, when God had set a signal mark upon him. When Men cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Judgments of the belief of a strict account, and dreadful Hell, and perpetual Immortality, their Hearts are pierc'd with their Sins like so many
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:200538:96"/> Darts. As they have a thousand Sins, so they have a thousand Stings; all pointed with God's Wrath, and return'd back with their own Hatred, though it is but the just fruit of their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The frequency of iniquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the more implacable Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and makes them as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Union to God, as of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in themselves.</p>
            <p>The Remedy then is, to labour for Justification by the Blood of Christ, which is only able to remove that Guilt which engenders our Hatred.</p>

            <p>Natural qualities encrease with the resistance of their Contraries; so doth Sin.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:200538:97"/> spoke good to natural Men in their own Esteem, and held them up in their Lust; his Truth would not be so much impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd in unrighteousness, but be highly ador'd with men's choicest Affections; but his commanding things according to his own holy Nature, brings into act that habitual Hatred which was before in the Heart. All Hatred doth arise from an opinion of destructiveness in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hated. Why do we loath a thing, but because we imagine it inconsistent with our Happiness and Wishes? And a Sinner being possess'd that his darling Sin is inconsistent with the Holiness of God's Law, hates God for being of a Nature so contrary to that which he loves. The disappointment our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Principles find by any Truth of God, exasperates the Heart. The <hi>Jews</hi> expecting an Earthly Grandeur by the <hi>M ssiah,</hi> and that they should be made Lords paramount of the World, was the Cause that they were the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Enemies to Christ when they found his design to be short of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and that his Humility fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd not their Pride, and his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:200538:97"/> was not like to raise him from the Footstool of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to the Throne of the World.</p>
            <p>The Remedy then is, To have a high Esteem of the Holiness and Wisdom of the Law of God, and the Advantages he aims at for our good in the enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. To account it better than thousands of Gold and Silver. To look upon his Commands as not grievous, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The greater the Love of Sin, the more must be our Hatred of God; because the more we love that which hath an Essential Enmity against God, the more we signify that it is our chief Good and Happiness, and consequently we must hate that which is most contrary to it, and would hinder our enjoyment of it: and therefore our hatred of God's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness grows up equally with our fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sin.</p>
            <p>When by frequent Acts the habitual Nature is strengthen'd, all the Powers of doing contrary is swallow'd up in that habit. Hence it is said, <hi>the carnal
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:200538:98"/> mind is enmity to God, i. e.</hi> the sensual mind, when Sensuality hath got the mastery of the mind, and planted sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual habits, there is Enmity to God; and it cannot be subject to the Law of God, because that habit wholly acts the mind. Men's Reasons side with the Precepts of God, and conclude them to be the way to felicity; but the Law of the Mind is too weak for the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleasing Charms of the Flesh, whereby they are drawn into an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paradise, but a real Captivity. The hating all the Dictates of God our Saviour is put upon this score. Light must be odious, when Darkness is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: God must needs be hated, when his Enemy is most caress'd. As the Love of God in the Godly is the Cause that they hate Sin, so the Love of Sin in the Wicked is the Cause that they hate God. Every Sin being an aversion from God in its own Nature, and a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Creature, according to the multiplying the Acts of Sin, this aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from God, and conversion to the Creature, must needs be encreas'd; and by how much the more Love we have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:200538:98"/> to the Creature, so much the more Love is taken from God.</p>
            <p>The Remedy then is, To endeavour for as great a Hatred of Sin as thou hast of God; to look upon Sin as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Evil in it self, the greatest disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to thy Happiness.</p>

            <p>It is proper to Men <hi>Odisse quos laese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint;</hi> whereas the person injur'd might rather hate, yet the person injuring hath often the greatest disaffection. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>'s Mistress first wrong'd him, and then hated him. <hi>Saul</hi> first injur'd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and then persecuted him; as if <hi>David</hi> had been the Malefactor, and <hi>Saul</hi> the Innocent. <hi>Italians</hi> have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb to this purpose; <hi>Chifa injuria ne pardonna mai.</hi> The Reason is, because they think the injur'd person must needs hate him; and Love is not an affection due to an Enemy. We have also suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thoughts of the person we have provok'd to be our Enemy. We wrong God, and then we hate him; measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Affections by humane Passions; and thinking, that because we have
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:200538:99"/> wrong'd him, he must needs lay aside all the Goodness and Patience of his own Nature, and watch the first Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Revenge. Every Sin and Act of it being Enmity to God, the more the habit of any Sin is encreas'd by frequent Acts, the more also is the habitual Enmity in the Heart increas'd: For as every Sin hath an immediate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the supply of some Lust, so it hath a remote and principal tendency to the encrease of that Enmity. <hi>Cain</hi> first affronts God in his Omniscience and Providence, and then departs from his Presence; turns his back upon him, and becomes the head of the prophane part of the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, i. e.</hi> from all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and Communion with him in Worship.</p>
            <p>The Remedy then is, To endeavour a Conformity to God's holy Will; to think with thy self every Morning, What shall I do this day to please God? what Duty doth he require of me? The more thou dost obey his Will, the more thou will love his Holiness.</p>

            <p>Men are apt to fear a just Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for an injury done to another, that he will do him one ill turn for another; and Fear is the Mother of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.

'Tis as natural for a man to hate that which he conceives to be against him, as for any Animal to hate that whose Acts it fears do tend to a dissolution of its Being. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils <hi>tremble,</hi> James 2.19. <gap reason="foreign">

The stronger the Impressions of Fear, the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:200538:100"/> quicker the Inclinations to Hatred. But when the Evil fear'd begins to strike, it makes the Hatred shoot out in Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Curses and Blasphemies, which is evident in the damn'd. God consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as a Judge, is the Object not of comforting, but terrifying Faith; No man can naturally love that Judge which he thinks will condemn him. A fear of God as an inexorable Judge, that we have highly wrong'd, will nourish an enmity against him.</p>
            <p>The Remedy then is, Be much in Communion with God; strangeness is the Mother of Fear; we dread Men sometimes, because we know not their disposition.

A Cause

'Tis the first Letter in the Alphabet of the Gospel of Peace, and therefore we are against him. Men lift up the Pride of Reason against the Truth of God, and the Pride of Heart against the Will of God. Hence it appears, that Self is the great Incendiary of the Soul against God. The Enmity of <hi>Tyre</hi> against God is charg'd upon this foot of account, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.2. <hi>Thy heart is lifted up in the midst of the sea; thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God.</hi> She would rather have her Wisdom admir'd by God, than God's Wisdom admir'd by her.

It had been against the Original Nature of a rational Creature, to be an enemy to that which is its chiefest Good. Our loving God doth not arise meerly from the Command of God enjoyning it, but from the Nature of God, and the Creatures relation to him. None but will confess, that had God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to love him, it had been highly abominable for a Creature to hate his Maker and Benefactor: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Moral Law or Decalogue, the Love of God is not explicitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but suppos'd as a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and indispensable Principle; from whence all other Commands are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Consequences: So that this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against God is not only against his Command, but against his very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and against the fundamental and indispensable Principle of all God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and all the Duties which as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures we owe to God.</p>

All ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred doth arise from an apprehension of the inconsistency of the thing we hate, with something we esteem a part of our happiness; and Sinners being possessed with the thoughts of the Justice and Holiness of God, as inconsistent with their Darling Sin, hate him for being of a Nature so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which they love; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

For if it were possible, as soon as ever he should cease to be Just and Righteous, he would cease to be God, and destroy his own Nature: For as every Man in doing an Unjust Act, is less than a Man, and loses the end of his own Reason; so God by doing any Injustice, would be less than a God. Nay our hating him as Judge, is highly irrational, because of his Equity, and Righteousness in all his proceedings.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:200538:135"/> they were, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. by the scrowl of their Sins. They were Rebels, and Rebels against him that had nursed them. Vers. 2. <hi>I have nourish'd and brought up children, and they have rebell'd against me:</hi> And in this respect worse than the Beasts they were masters of; the stupid Ox, and the dull Ass outstript them in ingenuity. Vers. 3. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</hi> He calls upon Heaven and Earth to judge between them, <hi>v.</hi> 2. He appeals to Men and Angels, as a Jury to give their Verdict, whether these People had not been the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous and ungrateful People in the World. Or if by Heavens and Earth be meant Magistrates and People, as in the Prophetick style they are usually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, God then appeals to themselves, to let their own natural Consciences, and the common Ingenuity their Sins had left them, to judge between them. He comes to charge them, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>laden with iniquity:</hi> They had such great weights lying upon them, that they were not able to stir; or laden with it,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:200538:135"/> as some Crab-tree is with sowr Fruit. They had sprouted from a wicked Stock; they had corrupted one another by their Society, and Example, as rotten Apples putrify the sound ones that lie near them.</p>
            <p>They had been incorrigible under Judgments; God had used the Rod again, and again; but being there was no reformation, he was even weary of whipping them any longer; v. 5. <hi>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt more and more.</hi> They were also so universally infected, that there was no sound part about them, but running Sores all over, both head and heart were infected; corrupt Notions in the one, and corrupt Affections in the other.</p>
            <p>Or if you take it Prophetically, Head signifies the Chief Magistrate; Heart, the Judges; Feet the common People. The Fire which had burnt their Cities, had not consum'd their Lusts, and dried up their Sins; <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Your country is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, your cities are burnt with fire, your land strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:200538:136"/> And had it not been for a small Remnant, they had been as bad as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> v. 9. Their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were polluted, vain, and an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to him, <hi>v.</hi> 13. A trouble to him, his Soul hated them, he was ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them, <hi>v.</hi> 14. for they came with their bloody murtherous hands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's presence.</p>
            <p>Yet though he justly charg'd them with these horrid Crimes, he gives them assurance of entertainment if they would return to him, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Come now, and let us reason together:</hi> He would condescend to debate the Case with them, when one would have thought he should have said, I'll have nothing to do with such a Crew as they; God loves to discourse with Men about this Argument of Pardon; and he loves that Men should hear him speak concerning it. He would dispute them out of their Sins, into good and right apprehensions of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Isa.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.</hi> Revolted, there is their Sin; deeply, there's the aggravation of it;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:200538:136"/> and being also Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> a People of much Mercy, and Miracles, there's another aggravation; yet turn unto him against whom you have thus sinn'd.</p>
            <p>The great Objection of a Penitent is, I have sinned, and I know not whether God will receive me: Consider, God knows thy Sin better than thou dost, yet he kindly calls to thee, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth thee as good a reception as if thou hadst never sinn'd.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>They say, If a man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast play'd the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me, saith the Lord.</hi> Though thou hast been a common Whore, and made all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, every Idol welcome, and been in league with many Sins; yet upon thy return I'll own thee; and these are God's warrants for encouragement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath given Examples of it in Scripture. Adam,</hi> the Ring-leader of all Rebellions of Mankind in the World,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200538:137"/> had the promise of the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to break the Serpents head made to him: And in the Genealogy of Christ, is call'd the Son of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38. not only in respect of Creation, for so the Devil is the Son of God; but in a nearer relation. Yet all that deluge of Wickedness which has overflow'd the World since the Fall, sprung out of his Loyns. Nay, <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, was probably an Idolater in <hi>Ʋr</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> and a Worshipper of the Sun, and Fire, as his Fathers were, <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.2. yet God makes a particular Covenant with this Man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him with a richer Act of Grace than any in the World besides him had, even that the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the World, should come from his Seed: This man is set up as the pattern of Faith to others, and his Bosome seems to be a great receptacle of Saints in glory, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22, 23. <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>'s Sins were as a thick Cloud, yet this powerful Sun did melt them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins.</hi> A sullen gloomy Morning
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:200538:137"/> often ends in a well-complexion'd Noon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manasseh</hi> is an eminent Example of this Doctrine. His story, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. represents him as black as a Devil, if all the aggravations of his Sin be consider'd.</p>

            <p>I shall only add this to the whole.</p>
            <p>Great Sins are made preparations by God to some mens Conversion, not in their own nature, that's impossible; but by the wise disposal of God, which Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> illustrates thus; As a Child whose Coat is but a little dirty, has it not presently wash'd; but when he comes to fall over head and ears in the mire, 'tis taken off, and wash'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; the Child might have gone many a day with a little dirt, had not such an Accident happen'd.</p>

               <hi>Peter</hi> might have had his proud and vain-glorious Humour still, had he not fell so foully in the denial of his Master; but when he fell into the Jakes, and Puddle, it promotes his Conversion: For so Christ calls it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren;</hi> 'twas Conversion in a new Edition; and you do not find him in the same boasting vanity again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi>'s falling into the Sin of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Adultery, is the occasion of the ransacking his Soul, which you find him not so hot about another time: He digs all about to the very Root, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</hi> This Sin had stirr'd and rak'd up all the mud in his heart, and made him see himself an abominable Creature: Therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 9. he desires God to <hi>hide his face from his sins;</hi> he was so loathsome, he would not have any one look upon him; (fling all this mud out of my Soul), and prays more earnestly for a new heart, and a right spirit. So when a wicked man falls into some grievous sin, which his Conscience frowns upon him, and

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Why God doth chuse the greatest Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and let his Elect run on so far in sin before he turns them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a passive disposition in the greatest Sinners, more than in moral or superstitious men, to see their need:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not any self-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to boast of. Man's blameless out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage and freedom from the common Sins of the Times and Places wherein they live, many times proves a snare of death to them, and makes them more cold and faint towards Christ: Because they possess themselves with imaginations, that Christ cannot but look upon them, though they never so much as set their faces toward him. And because they are not drencht in such Villanies as others are, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences sit quiet under this moral Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and gauls them not by any self-reflections: Therefore when the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law are denounc'd against
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:200538:146"/> such and such Sins, these men wipe their mouths, being untainted from those Sins that are thus curs'd, and vainly glory in their gay and gawdy Plumes, and bless God with the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see,</hi> that they are not Sinners of such a Scarlet dye, and that they do such and such Duties, and so go on without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a necessity of the new Birth; and by this means the strength of Sin is more compacted and condens'd in them.</p>
            <p>Superstitious and formal men are hardly reduc'd to their right Wits: Partly because of a defect in Reason, from whence those Extravagancies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise; and partly because those false ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and spirit of error possessing their Faculties, they are incapable of more generous impressions: Besides, they are more tenacious of the Opinions they have suckt in, which have got the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and command over their Souls; such misguided Zeal fortifies men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst proposals of Grace, and fastens them in a more obstinate inflexibleness to any converting-motions. This self-righteous Temper is like an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heat got into the Body, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:200538:147"/> an Hectick-Fever, and is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceived till it be incurable; and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally 'tis a harder matter to part with Self-righteousness, than to part with gross Sins: for that is more deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the stock of Self love, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which departs not from us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our very Nature: It hath more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to plead for it; It hath natural Conscience a Patron of it. Whereas a great Sinner stands speechless at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, and a faithful Monitor has a good Second and Correspondent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conscience within a man's own breast. It was not the gross Sins of the <hi>Jews</hi> against the light of Nature, so much as the establishing the Idol of their own Righteousness, that was the block to hinder them from submitting to the Righteousness of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.</p>
            <p>Christ came to his own, and his own receiv'd him not, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. Those that seem to have his peculiar stamp and mark upon them, that had their heads in Heaven by some kind of resemblance to God in Moral Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, being undefiled with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:200538:147"/> Pollutions of the World: These received him not, when Publicans and Harlots got the start of them, and run before them, to catch hold of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. <hi>Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you.</hi> Just as Travellers that have loyter'd away their time in an Alehouse, being sensible how the darkness of the night creeps upon them, spur on, and outstrip those that were many Miles on their way, and get to their Stage before them. So these Publicans and Harlots which were at a great distance from Heaven, arriv'd there before those, who like the Young man were not far off from it.</p>
            <p>Great Sinners are more easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the notorious wickedness of their Lives; and reflecting upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves because of their horrid Crimes against the light of Nature, are more inclinable to endeavour an escape from the Devil's slavery, and are frighted and shaken by their Consciences into a compliance with the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; whereas those that do by nature the things contained in the Law,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:200538:148"/> are so much a Law to themselves, that 'tis difficult to persuade them of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of conforming to another Law, and to part with this Self-law in matter of Justification. As Metals of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest substance are hardest to be polish'd; so Men of the most generous, natural and moral Endowments, are more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly argued into a state of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than those of more drossy Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Cassianus</hi> speaks very perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in this case; <hi>Frequenter vidimus de frigidis &amp; Carnalibus ad Spiritualem venisse fervorem de lepidis &amp; animalibus nunquam.</hi>

A change from Acts of Sin to Moral Duties, may be done by a natural strength, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of natural Conscience: For the very same Motives which led to Sin, as Education, Interest, Profit, may upon a change of Circumstances, guide men to an outward Morality; but a change to the contrary Grace is supernatural.</p>

            <p n="1">

The Wolf can never love the Lamb, nor the Lamb the Wolf; nothing but must act suitably to its Nature. Water cannot but moisten, Fire cannot but burn. So likewise the Corrupt Nature of Man being possest with an invincible contrariety and enmity to God, will never suffer him to comply with God. And the Inclinations of a Sinner to sin being more strengthen'd by the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of sinful Acts, have as great a power over him, and as natural to him, as any Qualities are to natural Agents. And being stronger than any Sympathies in the World, cannot by a man's own power, or the power of any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equal to it, be turn'd into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Channel.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Nothing can act beyond its own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Nature.</hi> Nothing in the World can raise it self to a higher rank
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:200538:149"/> of being, than that which Nature hath plac'd it in; A Spark cannot make it self a Star, though it mount a little up to Heaven; nor a Plant endue it self with Sense, nor a Beast adorn it self with Reason: Nor a Man make himself an Angel. Thorns cannot bring forth Grapes, nor Thistles produce Figs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such Fruits are above the Nature of those Plants. So neither can our Corrupt Nature bring forth Grace, which is a Fruit above it. <hi>Effectus non excedit Virtutem suae causae:</hi> Grace is more excellent than Nature, therefore cannot be the Fruit of Nature. 'Tis Christ's Conclusion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33, 34. <hi>How can you, being evil, speak good things?</hi> Not so much as the buds and blossoms of Words, much less the fruit of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They can no more change their Natures, than a Viper can cashier his Poyson. Now though this I have said be true, yet there is nothing Man does more affect in the World than a self-sufficiency, and an independency upon any other Power but his own. This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is as much riveted in his Nature, as any other false Principle whatsoever:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:200538:149"/> For Man does derive it from his first Parents, as the prime Legacy bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Nature: For it was the first thing discover'd in Man at his Fall; he would be as God, independent upon him. Now God, to cross this Principle, suffers his Elect, like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to lie in the Grave, till they stink, that there may be no excuse to ascribe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to their own Power. If a putrified rotten Carcass should be brought to life, it could never be thought that it inspir'd it self with that active Principle. God lets men run on so far in sin, that they do unman them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that he may proclaim to all the World, that we are unable to do any thing of our selves at first towards our recovery, without a superior Principle. The evidence of which will appear if we consider,</p>

When a man is thus bound by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Laws, a thousand Cords and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and carried whither his Lords please, against the dictates of his own Conscience, and force of natural light; can any man imagine, that his own power can rescue him from the strength of these Masters that claim such a right to him, and keep such a force upon him, and have so often baffled his own strength, when he offer'd to turn head against them.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:200538:150"/> being bound a Slave to these Lusts, as the Devil hath in binding him.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you see a man cast away his Pleasures, deprive himself of those Contentments to which his Soul was once knit, and walk in Paths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Corrupt Nature, you may search for the cause any-where, rather than in Nature it self.</p>
            <p>No piece of dirty muddy Clay can form it self into a neat and handsome Vessel; no plain piece of Timber can fit it self for the Building, much less a crooked one. Nor a man that is born blind, give himself Eyes.</p>

            <p>But God by such a forbearance shews himself to be God indeed, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Act infinitely above such a weak Creature as Man is, <hi>Hosea</hi> 11.9. <hi>I will not execute the fierceness of mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God had reckon'd up their sins before, and they might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Sentence, after the reading the Charge; God tells them, he would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:200538:151"/> not <hi>destroy them,</hi> he would not execute them, because he was <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he were not a God, he could not keep himself from pouring out a just Vengeance upon them. If a man did inherit all the Meekness of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all the Men that ever were in the World, he could not be able to bear with patience the Extravagancies and Injuries done in the World the space of one day: For none but a God, <hi>i. e.</hi> one infinitely long-suffering, can bear with them.</p>
            <p>Not a Sin past in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of Christ in the flesh, but was a Commendatory Letter of God's forbearance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.</hi> And not a sin past before the coming of Christ into the Soul, but gives the same testimony, and bears the same record. And the greater number of sins, and great sins are past, the more Trophies there are erected to God's long-suffering: The reason why the grace of the Gospel appear'd so late in the World, was to testify God's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:200538:152"/> Our Apostle takes notice of this long-suffering towards himself in bearing with such a Persecutor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me, first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him.</hi> This was Christ's end in letting him run so far, that he might shew forth not a few mites, grains, or ounces of Patience; but <hi>all long-suffering,</hi> long-suffering without measure, or weight, by whole-sale; and this as a Pattern to all the Ages of the World: <gap reason="foreign">

To show, that all the Ages of the World should not waste that Patience, whereof he had then manifested but a Pattern. A Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern we know is less than the whole Piece of Cloath from whence 'tis cut. And as an Essay is but a short taste of a man's skill, and doth not discover all his Art. As the first Miracle Christ wrought, of turning Water into Wine, as a Sample of what Power he had, was less than those Miracles which succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And the first Miracle God wrought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:200538:152"/> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in turning <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod into a Serpent, was but a Sample of his Power which would produce greater Wonders: So this patience to <hi>Paul</hi> was but a little Essay of his Meekness, a little Patience cut off from the whole Piece, which should always be dealing out to some Sinners or other; and would never be cut wholly out till the World had left being. This Sample or Pattern was but of the extent of a few years: For <hi>Paul</hi> was but young, the Scripture terms him a Young man, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.58.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sanctius</hi> in locum.</note> about 36 years of Age, yet he calls it all long-suffering. Ah <hi>Paul!</hi> some since have had more Yards cut out of this Patience, that have reached not only to 30, but 40, 50, 60 years.</p>

In this sense those things under the Earth shall bow down to that Name of Jesus, a Saviour. A Name which God gave him at first, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:200538:153"/> God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.</hi> And upon his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did confirm, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. when he was <hi>made perfect,</hi> i. e.

They shall confess that he is Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. <hi>i. e.</hi> that he acted like a Lord, when he prevail'd over all the opposition which those great Sinners made against him. The whole Trial of the Saints, and the Sentence of their Blessedness, shall be finished before that of the Damn'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35, 44. That the whole scene of his Love, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the work of Faith being laid open, might strike them with a vast amazement. And that this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Christ, to be thus glorified in his Grace, and Power, appears by the Apostle's Prayer, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12. that the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> might be in the number of those Christ should be thus glorify'd in.

Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conversion is an Act of Grace; <hi>Barnabas</hi> so interprets it, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.21, 23. when a great number believed; what abundance of Grace then is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in converting a company of extraordinary Sinners!</p>

            <p>He lets some Sinners run mightily upon his score, to manifest, that though they are beggar'd, yet his Grace is not. That though they have spent all their stock upon their swinish Lusts, yet they have not drain'd his Treasures; no more than the Sun is emptied of its strength, by exhaling the ill Vapours of so many Dunghils.

            </p>
            <p>None can entertain an imagination, that Christ should be a debtor to sin, unless in vengeance, much less a debtor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:200538:155"/> to the worst of Sinners. But if Christ should only take Persons of moral and natural Excellencies, men might su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that Christ were some way or other engag'd to them, and that the gift of Salvation were limited to the Endowments of Nature, and the good exercise and use of a man's own Will. But when he puts no difference between Persons of the least, and those of the greatest demerit, but affecting the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Monsters of sin, as well as the fairest of Nature's Children, he builds trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Arches to his Grace upon this Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, and makes Men and Angels admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly gaze upon these infinitely free Compassions; when he takes Souls full of Boils and Sores into his Arms. For 'tis manifest hereby, that the God and Lord of Nature is no more bound to his Servant, (as touching the gift of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) when she carries it the most smoothly with him, than when she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against him with the highest hand. And that Christ is at perfect liberty from any Conditions, but that of his own, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith; and that he can, and will embrace the dirt and mud, as well
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:200538:156"/> as well as the beauty and and varnish of Nature, if they believe with the like precious Faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore 'tis frequently God's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in Scripture, just before the offer of Pardon, to sum up the Sinner's Debts, with their aggravations; to convince them of their insolvency to satisfy so large a Score, and also to manifest the freeness and vastness of his Grace. <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.22, 23, 24. <hi>But thou hast not call'd upon me, O Jacob, but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel; Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt-offering,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> When he had told them how dirtily they had dealt with him, and would have made him a very slave to their corrupt Humours; at the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they, nor no Creature else, but would have expected fireballs of wrath to be flung in their faces, and that God should have dipt his Pen in Gall, and have writ their <hi>Mittimus</hi> to Hell, he dips it in Honey, and crosseth the Debt; <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:200538:156"/> will not remember thy sins.</hi> Could there be any thing of merit here, when the Criminal instead of favour could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing but severity, there being nothing but demerit in him?</p>
            <p>'Tis so free, that the Mercy we abuse, the Name we have profan'd; the Name, of which we have deserved wrath, opens its mouth with Pleas for us. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.21. <hi>But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profan'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathen whither they went.</hi> Not for their sakes.

            <p>Mercy of God is called his Riches,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:200538:157"/> and exceeding Riches of Grace. Now as there is no end of his Holiness, which is his Honour; neither any limits set to his Power: So there is no end of his Grace, which is his Wealth; no end of his Mines: Therefore the foulest and greatest Sinners are the fittest for Christ to manifest the abundant riches of his Graces upon: For it must needs argue a more vast Estate to remit great Debts, and many thousands of Talents, than to forgive some fewer Shillings, or Pence; than to pardon some smaller sins in men of a more unstain'd Conversation. If it were not for turning and pardoning Mountainous Sinners, we should not know so much of God's Estate. We should not know how rich he were, or what he were worth. He pardons Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities for his Name sake; and who can spell all the Letters of his Name, and turn over all the Leaves in the Book of Mercy? who shall say to his Grace, as he does to the Sea, Hitherto shalt thou go, and no further?</p>
            <p>As the Heavens are of a vast exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which like a great Circle encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the Earth, which lies in the middle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200538:157"/> like a little Atome, in comparison of that vast Body of Air and Aether; so are our sins to the extent of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.9. <hi>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi> Mens sins are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, yet they are but Cyphers to the vast Sums of Grace which are every day expended; because they are finite, but Mercy is infinite; so that all sins in the World put together, cannot be of so large an extent as Mercy: because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of them finite, if all laid together cannot amount to infinite.</p>
            <p>The Gospel is intit'led <hi>good will to men;</hi> to all sorts of men; with Iniquities, Transgressions and Sins, of all sorts and sizes. God hath stores of Mercy lying by him. His Exchequer is never empty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. Keeps <hi>mercy for thousands,</hi> in a readiness to deal it upon thousand millions of Sins, as well as millions of Persons. <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all that were before, have not wasted it; and if God were to proclaim his Name again, it is the same still, for his Name as well as his Essence is unchangeable.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:200538:158"/> His Grace is no more tied to one Sin, than 'tis to one Person: He has mercy on whom he will, and his Grace can pardon what Sins he will: Therefore he tells them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. that he would <hi>multiply</hi> Pardons: He will have mercy to sute every sin of thine, and a Salve for every Sore: Though thy sin has its heights, and depths, yet he will heap mercy upon mercy, till he makes it to over-top thy sin. He will be as good at his merciful Arithmetick, as thou hast been at thy sinful, if thou dost sincerely repent and reform. Though thou mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thy Sins by thousands, where Repentance goes before, remission of sin follows without limitation; when Christ gives the one, he is sure to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it with the other. Though ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating Circumstances be never so many, yet he will multiply his Mercies as fast as thou canst the Sins thou hast committed.</p>
            <p>He hath a cleansing Virtue, and a pardoning Grace for all Iniquities and Transgressions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.8. <hi>And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have sinned against me: And I will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:200538:158"/> pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed against me.</hi> 'Tis three times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, to shew, that his Mercy should be as large as their Sin, though there was not a more sinful Nation upon the Earth than they were. His Justifying and Sanctifying Grace should have as vast an extention: For he would both <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>cleanse</hi> them. Why? <hi>v.</hi> 9. That it might be a <hi>name of joy, and praise, and an honour</hi> to him before all the Nations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>'Tis so great, that Self-righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons murmur at it, that such Swines should be preferr'd before them. As the Eldest Son was angry that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should lavish out his kindness upon the Prodigal, more than upon himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.28.</p>

            <p>The formal nature of Mercy is Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and the natural effect of it is Relief. The more miserable the Object, the more compassionate Human Mercy is, and the more forward to assist. Now that Mercy which in Man is a Quality,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:200538:159"/> in God is a Nature. How would the infinite tenderness of his Nature be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, if there were no Objects to draw it forth? It would not be known to be Mercy, unless it were shed abroad; Nor to be tender Mercy, unless it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved great and oppressing Miseries. For Mercy is a Quality in Man that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep at home, and be stow'd under Lock and Key in a Man's own Breast. Much less in God, in whom 'tis a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now the greater the Disease, the greater is that Compassion disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to be, wherewith God is so fully stor'd.</p>
            <p>As his End in letting the Devil pour out so many Afflictions upon <hi>Job,</hi> was to shew his pity and tender mercy in relieving him; <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. <hi>You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pitiful, and of tender mercy.</hi> So in permitting the Devil to draw his Elect to so many Sins, 'tis the same End he drives at. And he is more pitiful, to help men under Sin, than under Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: because the guilt of one Sin is a greater misery than the burthen of a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:200538:159"/> thousand Crosses. If forgiveness be a part of tenderness in Man, 'tis also so in God, who is set, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. as a Pattern of the Compassion we are to shew to others. <hi>And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lower a man is brought, the more tender is that Mercy that relieves him; <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.8. <hi>Let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</hi>

            <p>To visit them that sit in darkness, and the shadow of death, and to pardon their sins, is call'd mercy with this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete of <hi>tender,</hi> Luke 1.77, 78, 79. <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited us.</hi> And so 'tis indeed, when he visits the most forlorn Sinners.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Ordinary pardon proceeds from his delight in mercy, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:200538:160"/> and passeth by the transgression of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.</hi> Therefore the more of his Grace he lays out upon any one, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of delight he hath in it; because 'tis a larger effect of that Grace. If he were not sincere in it, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mention mens Sins, which would scare them from him, rather than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them to him. If he were not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he would never change the heart of an Enemy, and shew kindness to him in the very act of enmity: For the first act of Grace upon us is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our wills. And man is so far from being active in it, that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. <hi>In primo actionis,</hi> 'tis thus with a man, though not <hi>in primo actu:</hi> For in the first act of Conversion, man is willing, though not in the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Act. But for God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his Grace upon us against our wills, and when he can expect no suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble recompence from us, evidences the purity of his Affection; That when he endured so many contradictions of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners against himself, day by day, yet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:200538:160"/> he is resolv'd to have them, and does seize upon them, though they struggle and fly in his face, and provoke him to fling them off.</p>
            <p>'Tis so much his delight, that 'tis call'd by the very name of his glory; <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.8. <hi>The glory of the Lord shall follow thee,</hi> i. e. The Mercy of the Lord should follow them at the very heels. And when they call, it should answer them; and when they cry, he would, like a watchful guardian Servant, cry out, Here I am. So that he never lets a great Sinner, when chang'd into a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, wait long for mercy; though he sometimes lets them wait long for a sense of it. This Mercy is never so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to him, as when 'tis most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and 'tis most glorious, when it takes hold of the worst Sinners. For such Black Spots which Mercy wears upon its face, makes it appear more beautiful.</p>
            <p>Christ does not care for staying, where he has not opportunities to do great Cures, suitable to the vastness of his Power, <hi>Mark</hi> 6 5. When he was in his own Country, he could do no great

So when men come to Christ with lighter guilt, he has but an under-opportunity given him, and with a kind of disadvantage, to manifest the greatness of his Charity. Though he has so much Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet he cannot shew more than the nature and exigence of the opportunity will bear; and so his Pleasure doth not swell so high, as otherwise it would do. For little Sins, and few Sins, are not so fit an Object for a Grace that would ride in triumph.

            <p>The Heavens are call'd the Works of God's Fingers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.3. But the Gospel in the effects of it, is call'd the Arm of the Lord; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.1. Men put not their Arm to a thing, but when the Work requires more strength than the Fingers possess. 'Tis the <hi>power of God</hi> to Salvation; and the faith it works is begun and fulfill'd with <hi>power,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.11.</p>
            <p>God created the World of nothing; nothing could not objectively contribute to his Design, as Matter does to a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Intent; yet neither doth it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him, because 'tis nothing. As soon as God spake the word, this Nothing brings forth Sun, Moon, Stars, Earth, Trees, Flowers, all the garnish of Nature out of its barren Womb. But Sin is actively disobedient, disputes his Commands, slights his Power, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:200538:162"/> it self against his entrance upon the heart, gives not up an inch of ground without a contest. There is not only a passive indisposition, but an active opposition. His Creating Power drew the World out of nothing, but his Converting Power frames the New Creature out of something worse than nothing.</p>
            <p>Naturally there is nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and confusion in the Soul; we have not the least spark of divine light, no more than the Chaos had, when God commanded light to shine out of that darkness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>shin'd</hi> in our hearts. To bring a principle of light into the heart, and to set it up in spight of all the opposition that the Devil, and a man's own Corruption makes, is greater than Creation. As the power of the Sun is more seen in scattering the thickest Mists that triumph over the Earth, and mask the face of the Heavens, than in melting the small Clouds compacted of a few Vapors; so it must needs argue a greater strength to root out those great Sins that were twisted and inlaid with our very Nature, and become as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:200538:162"/> dear to us as our right Eye, and right Hand, than a few Sins that have taken no deep root. Every man naturally is possess'd with a hatred of God, and doth oppose every thing which would restore God to his right: And being since the Fall fill'd with a desire of independency, which is daily strengthn'd with new recruits, and loth to surrender himself to the power and direction of another: 'Tis a more difficult thing to tame this unruly disposition in man's heart, I say more difficult than to annihilate him, and new create him again. As 'tis more easie oftentimes for an Artificer to make a new piece of Work, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and patch up an old one that is out of frame.</p>

So the greater

            <p>The work of Grace being a new Creation, is not only an Act of God's Power, but of his Wisdom; as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Creation was.

None can
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:200538:166"/> express better what a Lyon he was than he doth himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.10, 11. <hi>Many of the saints did I shut up in prison, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received authority from the chief Priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</hi> He seems also to have been a Man of a high and ambitious Spirit. This Persecuting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was acted so vigorously by him, to ingratiate himself with the Chief Priests, and as a means to step into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; for which he was endewed with Parts, and Learning, and would not want Zeal and Industry to attain it. He seems to be of a proud Spirit, by the temptation which he had, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>lest I should be exalted above measure.</hi> He speaks it twice in that Verse, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that his Natural Disposition led him to be lifted up with any Excellency he had: And usually God doth direct his Battery to beat down that which is the Sin of our Constitution.</p>

            <p>He was a man of a very honest mind, and was forward in following every Point his Conscience directed him to: For what he did against Christ, he did according to the Dictates of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as then inform'd, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my self,</hi> i. e. in my Conscience, <hi>that I ought,</hi> not that <hi>I might,</hi> but that it was his Duty.

            <p>Now it discovers the Wisdom of God to lay hold of this man, thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, who had honesty to obey the Dictates of a rightly inform'd Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well as those of an Erroneous one; Zeal to execute them, and height of Spirit to preserve his Activity from being blunted by any opposition; and Parts and Prudence for the management of all these.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:200538:170"/> there need not be; because this Sacrifice was compleat, otherwise there would be a remembrance of Sin: As the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant implied the compleatness of Christ's Satisfaction, so the continual fulfilling or application of the tenor of the Covenant, implies the perpetual savour and force of this Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>And indeed when God deliver'd him up, he intended it for the greatest Sins. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>He was deliver'd for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which signifies not stumbling, but falling. Not a light, but a great transgression. Now if Christ's Death be not satisfactory for great Debts, Christ must be too weak to perform what God intended by him, and so Infinite Wisdom was frustrate of its Intention, which cannot, nor ought not to be imagin'd. Now therefore God takes the greatest Sinners to shew,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. First the <hi>Value of this Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God should only entertain men of a lighter guilt, Christ's Death would be suspected to be too low a Ransom for Monstrous Enormoties; and that his Treasure was sufficient for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:200538:171"/> of smaller Debts, but a penury of Merit to discharge Talents; which had not been a Design suitable to the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of Christ, or the infiniteness of that Mercy God proclaims in his Word. But now the Conversion of Giantlike Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners doth credit the Atonement which Christ made; and is a great renewed Approbation of the infinite Value of it, and its equivalency to God's Demands: For it bears some analogy to the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ, which was God's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Acquittance to Christ, to evidence the sufficiency of his Payment. And the justification of every Sinner is a branch of that Acquittance given to Christ at his Resurrection; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Rais'd again for our justification.</hi> And a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acquittance to Christ for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soul he had the charge of from his Father. All that Power that works in the first creation of Grace, or the progress of Regeneration, bears some proportion to the acquitting and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Power manifested in Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who believe according to the working
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:200538:171"/> of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he rais'd him from the dead.</hi> In <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. the Apostle prays for the carrying on the work of Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation begun in them, that they might more clearly understand that Power which wrought in Christ; <hi>viz.</hi> that approving Power of what Christ has done, which he exerts daily in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and in the effects of it. For by raising any Soul from a death in Sin, God doth evidence the particular value of Christ's Blood for that Soul, as he did in raising Christ, evidence the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral fulness of that Satisfaction. And this he will do even to the end of the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>rais'd us up together with Christ: —Kindness through Christ Jesus.</hi> All his Grace in all Ages, even to the end of the World, shall run through this Channel, to put Credit and Honour upon Christ. Now the greater the Sin is that is pardon'd, and the greater the Sinner is that is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more it shews the sufficiency of the Price Christ paid.</p>

            <p>He is a <hi>Priest for ever,</hi> Heb. 7.17. and therefore the Virtue as well as the Value of his Sacrifice remains for ever: He hath obtained an <hi>eternal redemption, Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>i. e.</hi> a Redemption of an Eternal Efficacy.</p>
            <p>As long as men receive any Venom from the fiery Serpent, they may be healed by the Antitype of the Brazen one, though it were so many years since he was lifted up.

            <p>Now the new Conversions of Men of extraordinary guilt, proclaims to the world, that the fountain of his Blood is inexhaustible; that the virtue of it is not spent, and drain'd, though so much hath been drawn out of it for these Five thousand years and upwards for the cleansing of Sins past before his coming, and Sins since his Death. This evidences that his Priesthood now is of as much efficacy as his Sufferings on

            <p>Men at their first Conversion receive the Grace of God with astonishment; for 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

But suppose a man had been all his life-time like a Mole under ground, and had never seen so much as the light of a Candle, and had a view of that weak Light at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, how would he admire it, when he compares it with his former Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? But if he should be brought fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to behold the Moon with its train of Stars, his Amazement would increase with the Light. But let this Person behold the Sun, be touched with its warm Beams, and enjoy the pleasure of seeing those Rarities which the Sun dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, he will bless himself, adore it, and embrace that Person that led him to enjoy such a Benefit. And the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Darkness he sat in before, will endear the present Splendor to him, swell up such a spring tide of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that there shall be no more spirit in him.</p>
            <p>God lets men sit long in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, and run to the utmost of Sin, before he stops them, that their Danger may enhance their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:200538:174"/>
            <p>We admire more when we are pull'd out of danger, than when we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from running into it. A Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor will be more thankful for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when it comes just as he is going to be turn'd off. If there be degrees of Harmony in Heaven, without question the Convert Thief on the Cross warbles out louder Notes than others, because he had little time to do it on Earth; and his Engagements are the greater, because Christ took him in his Arms when he was hanging over Hell.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epistle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> he was about 55 years of age, and yet those 20 years run out since his Conversion had not stifled his Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor dampt his Thankfulness for Converting Grace. Take a prospect of it in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me into the Ministry, who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> I thank Christ Jesus our Lord.

Who would imagine, but that of all Persons he should have past by me, while he had taken this or that polished <hi>Pharisee,</hi> this or that Doctor of Morality? but that he should overlook them, and set his eye upon me, so injurious, such a Blasphemer, such a Persecutor! A great Sinner, when he reflects upon his Sin, wonders that a <hi>But</hi> was not made at him. You find that no Apostle gives such Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes to the Grace of God as our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle does. None so Seraphical in his admiring Expressions.

               <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom Christ had cast seven Devils, was most early in her affection, to bestow her provision of Spices upon the dead Body of her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The fire of Grace cannot be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, but will break out in glory to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:200538:175"/> God. This is such a Grace, that Man in innocency could not have exercis'd in such a height; because now the Sinner is not only in his own sight unworthy of pardon, but worthy of the greatest hatred and punishment. You scarce find your selves possessed with greater affection to any, than those who have been Instruments to free you from your sinful Fetters. How often do you bless them, could pull out your Eyes for them, and think all ways too little to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the sense of your obligations to them! And doth the Instrument carry away all? surely God has the greatest Sacrifice of Affection, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert considers that his powerful Grace was the principal Agent to draw him out of this spiritual Mire. As when a Present is sent to you, you shew a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy to the Servant, but the chief part of your kindness is devoted to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that sent him. What flames of Love, raptures of Joy, transports of Affection, boilings of Courage for God in a young Convert! The Soul is most couragious for God at first Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, because 'tis then most stor'd with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:200538:175"/> Comforts; and is so struck into amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the marvellous light which darts upon him, that he is ambitious to be a Martyr for God presently; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>After that you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.</hi> Grace is not only attended with Afflictions, but bestows a Courage upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to endure them. The Soul then thinks it is able to undergo any thing for God, who hath bestow'd so much Grace upon it.</p>
            <p>A Christian hath the greatest love to Christ at the first turning to him: For since the horror of all his Sins, and the natural ugliness and deformity of that which he has serv'd so long, comes with a full sense upon him; And since the admirable Excellency of Christ shines upon him, which is a sight he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquainted with before; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the danger he was in, and the incomparable love which beams upon him from his believing a Saviour, fills his Affection with full Sails.</p>
            <p>Thus do men, who have been tossed in a dangerous Tempest, afflicted with the darkness of the night, as well as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:200538:176"/> their danger, rejoice, and welcome the Rising Sun in the Morning, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels their tumultuous Fears, as well as those gloomy Shadows.</p>
            <p>God permits a man's Sins to abound, that his Love after pardon may abound too; <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. <hi>Her sins which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are forgiven: for she loved much.</hi>

And this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation agrees best with the following words, <hi>To whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</hi> 'Tis more consonant to Reason, that where there are greater Mercies, there should be greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Affection. Remission of Sins is the greatest evidence of God's Love, and therefore should be the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive of ours. And indeed Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appears to a Penitent with a more comely air in his Countenance, than upon the removal of great Judgments, or the pardon of great Sins. <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.2. <hi>In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely, for them that are escaped of Israel.</hi> In <hi>that</hi> day, in what day?

That <hi>Peter,</hi> who had been so criminal in denying his Master, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Perjury to his Perfidiousness, was as active in service, as he had been in apostacy.

            <p>Never an Apostle that had been bred up under Christ's Wing, that was so active an Instrument as this <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been so bitter an Enemy.

            <p>Christ chose the <hi>foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. that nothing should be attributed to their Worth and Dignity, but to his Grace and Mercy. Were the Gospel disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd only to the wise, they would look upon it rather as a discovery made by the Opticks of their own Reason. And if God did bestow his Grace only upon men of unspotted Conversations, they would rather think it a debt God stood obliged to pay them, than a free act of Grace. As God reveals knowledge to the simplest, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.25. so he doth manifest Grace to the sinfullest; and as Christ blest his Father for that, so no doubt but he doth return the same thanks for this. Such great Sinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all from God, and so have more reason to hang down their heads; others may sometimes cast many a loving

            <p>But such who were fallen over head and ears in the mire, and were dirty all over, have no cause to boast: For God did not find them, but made them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. They brought nothing but Dirt and Rags, that were not worthy the washing; only God would pick glory out of their worthlesness, to his own Grace. Such are sensible, that God was not their debtor, but they his; and that there was nothing in them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige God to bestow the least Mite of mercy on them.</p>

            <p>Such are asham'd of their Sins not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the instant of their Conversion,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:200538:180"/> but afterwards, every time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now asham'd? Now,</hi> at that time, when <hi>Paul</hi> writ to them; the very shame of their Sins stuck upon them, though they had been converted before. The more they grew in the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge of God and his goodness, the more a holy shame for Sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their natural condition was stirr'd in their Consciences; and they could not but blush every time they consider'd how dirty they had been towards God. Now the greater the shame, the greater the hatred of the occasion of that shame, and the more exact the watchfulness against it. As a man that hath fallen into some Slough by some stumble or over-sight, when he travels that way again, he cannot but remember what a pickle he was in, and will be watchful lest he meet with the same mishap. Whose heart was more melted by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s?

Her Eyes, which had enflam'd so many Hearts, been Snares to catch men, she makes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits to convey her penitential Tears to her Saviour's Feet. Her Hair, which had engross'd so much time in the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Dresses, she uses as a Towel to wipe them. The Ointment she had us'd for the tricking up her self, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Senses of her Lovers, she pours out to embalm her Lord. Her Lusts should have no more of her choicest things, but her Saviour should have all. She would keep them not so much for her own use, as his.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Pardoning such great Sins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting such great Sinners, is the best Credential Letter Christ brings with him from Heaven; Men naturally would scarce believe him for his own sake, but for his Works sake they would; because they are more led by Sense than Faith. This Christ knew, when he bids his Disciples believe him for the Works sake, that he was sent by God, and that they are unanimous in this Work of Grace, as well as in other Works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very works sake.</hi> Therefore those that have been Partakers of this Converting Grace, if they stagger, and doubt afterwards, they give the greatest affront to Christ.</p>
            <p>For their unbelief is not only against his Person, but against his Work too. That he has far more reason to say to such, than he did to his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.17. <hi>How long shall I be with you! &amp;c.</hi> what should I stay to do such great Works as these, and cannot be believed?</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:200538:182"/>
            <p>Such great Sins pardon'd, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd, make men take faster hold of Christ afterward. As a man that hath lately got out of a deep Lake, wherein there were many Serpents, Crocodiles, and Venomous Creatures, which he has escap'd, and has no Sanctuary to protect him from their fury, but by hanging upon a small Bough; when he looks down upon them, and sees them gaping for him, and ready to devour him, if he were within their reach, he will summon up all his strength to hold fast that Branch. In such a day will the <hi>Branch of the Lord</hi> also be beautiful and glorious.</p>
            <p>Certainly, when the Soul went out to Christ in so desperate a Condition, with the load of guilt and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, and resolv'd to venture upon him come what would of it, and found success; As it was the boldest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, which the Scripture frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls boldness, so 'tis the greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to come to Christ upon any occasion whatsoever hereafter. This first act of Faith is of so noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a quality, that 'tis set as the Copy
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:200538:182"/> of all following Acts of Faith, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 14. <hi>Beginning of your confidence;</hi>

               </gap>; the primary Act of Faith, which was the principal Act of Confidence.</p>
            <p>Though there is a greater strength in the habit of Faith after Conversion, yet the first exercise of it upon Christ is the boldest and most vigorous, because it was for the saving the life, when the Soul saw no recovery any way but in Christ; and the most noble, when it was under the discouragements of such mountains of Guilt.</p>
            <p>It also gave Christ the greatest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for it was an act of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him than any succeeding act could be. Now if thou didst put forth such a high and daring Act of Faith, when all thy sins hung about thee, and thou hadst neither a <hi>Hur</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi> to hold up thy hands, with much more confidence mayest thou come now, since thou hast tried how successful thy first Faith hath been. So when Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons assault thee, and the Devil with all his black Legions besets thee round, thou art not in a worse condition than at the first, when all thy sins did not only
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:200538:183"/> besiege thee, but possess thee; well may such a Soul say, If I acted Faith when the Devil had all the Strong-holds in me, at the worst; now 'tis but to start out, and exercise the power of that first Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In case of Corruptions likewise, and unmaster'd sins:</hi> I have great Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the Power which raised Christ, raised me, when I had greater Stones upon me, wherewith I had even wearied God himself; and now when I have fewer, though they are too great still, shall I despair of that Power which wrought greater Miracles for me, and threw away my Grave-Stones, when I was not able to stir my self?</p>
            <p n="4">4. So <hi>in case of Desertion.</hi> I'll ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to go to God, let him frown and strike; for I am sure I did once go to him when I was his absolute sworn Enemy, and he had not a greater Hater of him in the world than I was, and he did receive me: I am not worse now than I was at that time; for I love him, and would do all that I can to please him; therefore I will press into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence now, and try the success of my first Faith.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:200538:183"/>
            <p>Such mens Faith is usually a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Faith, because they have less of the Principle of Reason to support it. 'Tis like that of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, a believing <hi>in hope against hope,</hi> 4. Rom. 18. A Faith against mighty and mountainous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of high and mighty sins, that might scare a man from such acts of Faith, and establish a diffidence of the Promises of God in the Soul: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no more Glory from the Faith of any, than from those of the greatest Sinners through their Repentance.</p>

After a man's return to God, his fear of God is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon a more ingenuous account; for he fears God and <hi>his goodness,</hi> 3. <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. whereas before he feared God and his Power, God and his Justice. And the <hi>Jews</hi> of whom he there speaks, shall fear, or reverence that Goodness the more; because the sin he has pardoned was so great, as the crucifying the Son of God, which according to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wish lay upon the heads of all their Posterity.</p>
            <p>God's Goodness once tasted, will make Ingenuity afraid to offend him. Self interest also will make them afraid to provoke that Mercy that formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them, to cashier them out of his Favour.</p>
            <p>When the man was in the deep Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where the Fetters of Sin entred into his very Soul, and bound up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Terrors of the Law, when Mercy stepped in, and delivered him,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:200538:184"/> and poured Oyl into his Wounds, He will be afraid to provoke that Mercy to leave him in the same condition in which it found him, and from whence it drew him. He will be loath to be numbred amongst the Crew of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, and Bank of Gally-slaves, from whence he has been redeemed. He that hath tasted the bitterness of Sin, will fear to commit it; and he that hath felt the sweetness of Mercy, will fear to offend it.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:200538:185"/> drew of his own Heart, and expos'd to the view of the World, that they might know by the gracious Entertainment, and high advancement of those Sinners, how liberal he is, and would always be in the distributions of his Grace, that Penitent Sinners of as great Stains might be encourag'd in all Ages to rely upon him. This was his Design in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Conversion in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, for this cause I obtain'd mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi> A Pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him. He sets up this Apostle as a White Flag to invite Rebels to treat with him, and return to their Loyalty. As every great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a grand Sinner is as the hanging a Man in Chains, to deter others from the like practice; so every Conversion is not only an act of God's Mercy to the Convert, but an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Spectators.</p>
            <p>This is the Argument <hi>David</hi> useth to persuade God to pour into him the joy of his salvation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.12, 13.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:200538:185"/>
               <hi>Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, &amp;c.</hi> I'll make all <hi>Jerusalem</hi> ring of it; and Sinners seeing the multitude and long Train of thy tender Mercies, shall fly into thy Arms to be partakers of the same Grace. For every great Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is as a Sea-mark, to guide others into a safe harbour. And indeed this he tells God, when he had receiv'd Pardon, that this would be the issue of God's Pardon to <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 32.5, 6. which is thought to be penn'd upon the same occasion, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. when <hi>v.</hi> 5. he had been forgiven, he tells God what the effect upon others would be, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>For this shall every one that is godly,</hi> &amp;c. Judging it the fittest time to come when God is dealing out his Mercy. Such effects we find when Christ was upon the Earth; when Christ call'd <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> 2.14. the next news we hear, <hi>v.</hi> 15. is, that many Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners sat down with him, and follow'd him. Many of the same Tribe were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by this kindness to one of their Fellows, to attend upon him.</p>
            <p>As when a Physician comes into an House where many are sick, and cures
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:200538:186"/> one that is desperate, 'tis an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the rest to rely upon his Skill.</p>
            <p>When Christ gives an Experiment of his Art on any Sinner near thee, 'tis a Call from Heaven as well to excite thy Emulation to come to him, as thy Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment at it. As the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was to provoke the <hi>Jews</hi> to Jealousy; 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>Salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed such Conversions may more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally move men, than any Miracle can objectively move the Sense. To see such a remarkable Change wrought in the Soul of a Devil, in a Diabolical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If men believe not in Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sight of such standing Miracles, 'tis an aggravation of their Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as much as any Miracle Christ wrought upon the Earth, was of the <hi>Jews</hi> Obstinacy, and does put as black a dye upon it. 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 32. <hi>Ye when you had seen it, repented not afterward, that you might believe him.</hi> Not any great Sinner that thou hast seen take Heaven by violence, but is writ down by God as a <hi>Yet</hi> upon all thy unbelief. And how
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:200538:186"/> many hundred <hi>Yets</hi> may Christ bring against thee, upon the account of others converted round about thee. The <hi>Yet</hi> set upon <hi>Paul</hi> may refer to this, 9 <hi>Acts</hi> 1. because in the foregoing Chapter <hi>Luke</hi> had related the successful progress of the Gospel in <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was an evidence of the Power of this new Doctrine: <hi>Yet Paul</hi> proceeded in his persecuting Fury, against such clear Testimonies.</p>
            <p>Had you been in the times of Christ, and seen those Miracles he wrought among the <hi>Jews,</hi> you would all think you should never have been so stupid as they were, but would presently have believ'd in him upon a sight of those Wonders. Let me tell you, the Success of Christ's Grace upon the Souls of men, whereof you have seen many Evidences, is a greater Miracle, by Christ's own confession, than usually he wrought: For he tells the Apostles, they should work <hi>greater works,</hi> 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. which he means of their Success in converting work. And so thy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency has as great aggravations as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Perversity. Let every such
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:200538:187"/> Conversion of a great Sinner be a ground of hope to thee, and a spur in thy side.</p>
            <p>Further, such Conversions evidence that God's Commands are practicable, that his Yoke is not burthensome. Men naturally think God a hard Master, that his Commands are impossible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but when they see men that had lain soaking in Sin many years, to have a fresh and fair Verdure by Grace, to run with delight in the ways of God's Commands: When they see men that had the greatest prejudices against the ways of God, throughly turn'd, they may think with themselves, Why may not I observe those Commands? Is it more impossible for me, than such a one? 'Tis natural to men not to believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they see Miracles; 4. <hi>John</hi> 48. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</hi> Therefore all the standing Miracles God hath left in the world, are the extraordinary Conversions of men, and the worst of men, that men may thereby be convinced of the Power of the Gospel, and the Strength of his Grace, by seeing the admirable effects
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:200538:187"/> of it upon others; for many times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version begins in admiration.</p>

But upon Faith, saith he, <hi>Thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> Plead therefore with Christ, and say, Thou didst come to do thy Father's Will, which was, that none should be cast off that come unto thee; and thou hast said the same; 'tis not sufficient for thee to say it merely, and not to do it.

               <p>Did he ever let any one that came to him with a great infirmity, go back without a Cure, and dishonour himself so much, as that it should be said, It was a Distemper too great for the Power of Jesus to remedy? And why should there be any Sin that he cannot pardon? 'Tis as easy for him to heal the one as the other: For he did with as much ease and delight say, <hi>Thy sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee;</hi> as say, <hi>Take up thy bed, and walk.</hi>

If thou hadst Ten thousand Legions, I dare say Christ would not lose an opportunity of such a Conquest: For it would please him more to do great works than little, and to show how far his Power can reach.</p>
               <p>Were it not for such Objects, we could not know whether he could <hi>save to the utmost,</hi> or no, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 25. What has he this Ability for? to lye idle? No

               <p>Some question whether Christ will pardon them, for they look upon him as a hard Master, that will not easily forgive. But Christ gives another Character of himself, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28, 29. when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts men to come to him; he tells them they must not judge him to be of a rugged and implacable nature, but as <hi>meek</hi> as they are sinful. Meekness is seen in pardoning of Injuries, not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in memory, to beget and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Revenge. Now the greater the Provocation, the more transcendent is that Meekness to pass it by.</p>
               <p>Did he ever upbraid any with their Offences, and hit them in the teeth with their former Extravagancies? 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 44.

And would his Father's love to him, and the greatness of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God be discover'd, by granting some small Requests, the pardon of a few and little Sins? Christ is consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Priest by the Oath of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28. would God put himself to his Oath for a light business, a thing of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What is the end of this Oath? Compare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. <hi>For men verily swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it by an oath:</hi> And all is that you might have <hi>strong consolation.</hi> What strong Comfort could there be, if only
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:200538:203"/> little Debts were remitted? What is the end of an Oath? <hi>v.</hi> 16. to take away <hi>strife;</hi> Men do not strive with God, or doubt of his Mercy to forgive little Sins: For they think that will be done of course. But the great contest men have with God, is about his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to remit great Debts, scarlet Sins: Upon this account the strife is between God and doubting Sinners; therefore to bring this Contest to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, God hath put himself to his Oath, and sworn that Christ should be a Priest for ever, to take away all strife between him and believing Sinners.</p>
               <p>For whom is this strong consolation founded upon God's Oath? <hi>v.</hi> 18. For those that <hi>fly for refuge.</hi> Now the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of refuge were not appointed for ordinary Crimes, but for blood, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Malefactor from the Avenger.</p>
               <p>Shall I add further, God is best pleas'd with Christ when he makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for the greatest Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
               <p>Suppose thou hadst been one of Christ's Murtherers, and hadst given thy Vote against him; perhaps thou
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:200538:203"/> wouldst have thought this a more Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Sin than any thou art guilty of.</p>
               <p>You know Christ pray'd for their pardon while he was upon the Cross. And God gives this as one reason why he would exalt him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>He shall divide him,</hi> &amp;c. why? because he pour'd out his Soul to death. What should he bear sin for, if God had no mind to pardon it? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was <hi>numbred among the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,</hi> which the Evangelist under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands of his being crucified with Thieves, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.28. And therefore his making intercession for Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, must be understood of his Prayer upon the Cross. And if God did exalt him for this, would God be pleased with him, or would Christ answer the end of his Exaltation, if he did cease to make intercession for Sinners of the like stamp?</p>
               <p>Tell God, that he sent Christ to bless you, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. in converting you; and desire Christ to do his Office.</p>

               <p>Christ is God's Lord Almoner for the dispensing Redemption, and the riches of his Grace. To whom? Not to the Righteous, they have no need of it; but to Sinners, and those that have the greatest necessity.</p>
               <p>He would be an ill Steward, who when intrusted by his Lord to bestow his Alms upon the Poor, should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the most miserable, indigent, and necessitous Persons, when they crave it of him, and relieve those that had not so great and crying Wants.</p>
               <p>Christ is a Priest for intents of the same nature as the Legal Typical Priests were. They were to have compassion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to measure out their compassion, to order the Sacrifice according to the nature of the sin of the Person that presented it. So is Christ by virtue of his Office to measure out his Grace according to the greatness of a man's necessity; as Manna was to be gathered according to every ones wants.</p>
               <p>Well then, to conclude this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Embolden thy self to draw near to Christ. 'Tis the Apostle's use
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:200538:204"/> he makes of all his foregoing Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God requires not a heart without sin, but a heart without guile. Who needs more boldness than great Sinners? And the Apostle sets no limits to it. Let us, who have been as great Sinners as any, resolve to do as they in <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 22. They had both a Command, and a Promise. <hi>Return,</hi> there's the Command. <hi>I will heal,</hi> &amp;c. there's the Promise. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, they reply, <hi>We will come to thee,</hi> &amp;c. They seem to snatch the Promise out of God's mouth.</p>
               <p>How will these quick and ready Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts rise up in judgment against thy slowness and dulness? Shall they do this upon one Promise; and when thou hast all the Promises in the Book of God repeated to thee, shall God hear no other answer but this, We will not return, or we dare not come, we dare not believe thee?</p>
               <p>Did God give but one Promise to <hi>Adam,</hi> and did he embrace it, and live upon it all his life; (for we read of no more he had than that of the Seed of the Woman breaking the Serpent's head)
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:200538:205"/> and wilt thou not return, when thou hast so many Promises filling every page in the Scripture?</p>
               <p>Hast thou not a world of Precedents? Did not God take up all his Saints from the Dunghil with all their Rags, and clothe them? Were any of them born Princes, and Sons of Heaven? Alas, every man at first sued for a Saviour in the right of a Sinner; and all pleaded in the Court of Heaven <hi>in formâ pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris.</hi> Were they not Debtors, and could they do that which might make God cross out one of those Sums they ow'd him? Oh think not then thou canst damm up that torrent of Love that has flow'd so freely to the World for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages. Tho' thy Disease be grievous, yet 'tis not irrecoverable, provided thou goest to the Physician. He can with a breath burn up thy Corruption, as soon as dissolve the Creation. Christ can turn the muddiest water into such Wine that can please the heart both of God and Man. As you have been Vessels of Sin, if you will be Vessels of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, God will make you brimful of Mercy. Plead not therefore thy own
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:200538:205"/> unworthiness. Man's unworthiness ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet hindered the flowing of God's kindness. 'Tis too weak a Bank to stop the current of God's favour. The greater thy unworthiness, the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage has free Grace to manifest its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Excellency. That Man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours God, that sets his Sin above God's Goodness, or his Unworthiness above God's Condescension. You cannot do God a greater pleasure, than to come to him to be made clean. When he reckons up thy Sin, 'tis not with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding, but a compassionate sigh, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. He longs for the time of thy returning; and minds thee of thy Sin, that thou mayst the sooner seek a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and wonders thou wilt continue in such a filthy Condition so long.</p>

Freeness of Grace should make us increase holiness in a more chearful manner.

No, 'tis to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on it, to make that which should excite thee to holiness, a Bawd to thy Lust, and God himself a Pandar to the Devil.</p>

               <p>See what an answer <hi>Paul</hi> gives to such an imagination, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Let us do evil, that good may come, whose dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is just.</hi> He takes a handful of Hell-fire and flings it in their faces.</p>
